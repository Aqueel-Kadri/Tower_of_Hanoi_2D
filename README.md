Platform: Unity

Files present: 2
1. Game Executable.rar : Contains .exe version of game
2. Project Folder.rar  : Contains Project Folder named "ToH2D" which can be opened in Unity

Main Features:
-2D Drag and Drop Game with 3 Towers and 5 disks
-I have implemented a Snapping Feature which makes sure that the Disks will snap to the appropriate tower if they are released. 
-This Feature makes sure that the disks do not fall in a random position on the screen when released.
-The Snap feature was implemented by using the geometric position of the towers.
-The player has full control over the drag feature once they have removed the disk from its respective tower and are making their next decision.
-The Project has been designed to follow all of the rules stated by the problem:
    Only Topmost Disk of Each Stack is Draggable
    A larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller one
    The Player wins when they have replicated the entire stack on one of the 2 other towers
